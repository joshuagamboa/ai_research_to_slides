# Components Directory

This directory contains Vue components following the atomic design principles:

- **atoms**: Smallest functional units such as buttons and input fields
- **molecules**: Combinations of atoms to form functional components
- **organisms**: Groups of molecules working together in larger sections
- **templates**: Page structures composed of organisms

Each component is designed to be reusable and follows the single responsibility principle.
